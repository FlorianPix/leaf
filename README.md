To create a gif you just need to run heart/heart.pde which outputs all frames as png files.
Those need to be converted to single gif files with the heart/output/convert.bat.
After that all the gif files can be stitched together to one file with heart/output/gif.bat.

The bat files are very simple and can easily be replicated with bash if you need to.
